              <strong>charity: water</strong>&nbsp;optimized their mobile and
              web donation flows with Stripe so they can focus on what really
              matters: bringing clean water to every person on the planet. Using
              Stripe, they also built a new monthly giving program, which makes
              it even easier for subscribers to donate throughout the year.

              As&nbsp;<strong>Slack</strong> grows rapidly, using Stripe helps
              them scale payments easilyâ€”supporting everything from getting paid
              by users around the world to enabling ACH payments for corporate
              customers.
